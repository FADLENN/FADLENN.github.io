		<h2><font color="#E94D1C">Traffic experiment reveals the nature of 
car-following</font></h2>
		<p style="font-size:18px";line-height: 50px align="justify">As a 
typical self-driven many-particle system far from equilibrium, traffic 
flow exhibits diverse fascinating non-equilibrium phenomena, most of 
which are closely related to traffic flow stability and specifically 
the growth/dissipation pattern of disturbances. However, the traffic 
theories have been controversial due to a lack of precise traffic data. 
We have studied traffic flow from a new perspective by carrying out 
large-scale car-following experiment on an open road section, which 
overcomes the intrinsic deficiency of empirical observations. The 
experiment has shown clearly the nature of car-following, which runs 
against the traditional traffic flow theory. Simulations show that by 
removing the fundamental notion in the traditional car-following models 
and allowing the traffic state to span a two-dimensional region in 
velocity-spacing plane, the growth pattern of disturbances has changed 
qualitatively and becomes qualitatively or even quantitatively in 
consistent with that observed in the experiment.</p>

		<h2><font color="#E94D1C">Car following behavioral stochasticity analysis and modeling: Perspective from wave travel time</font></h2>
		<p style="font-size:18px";line-height: 50px align="justify">This paper 
analyzes the car following behavioral stochasticity based on two sets 
of field experimental trajectory data by measuring the wave travel time 
series τ ̃_n (t) of vehicle n. The analysis shows that (i) No matter the 
speed of leading vehicle oscillates significantly or slightly, τ ̃_n (t) 
might change significantly; (ii) A follower's τ ̃_n (t) can vary from 
run to run even if the leader travels at the same stable speed; (iii) 
Sometimes, even if the leader's speed fluctuates significantly, the 
follower can keep a nearly constant value of τ ̃_n (t). The Augmented 
Dickey-Fuller test indicates that the time series ξ_n (t)=dτ ̃_n (t)/dt 
follows a mean reversion process, no matter the oscillations fully 
developed or not. Based on the finding, a simple stochastic Newell 
model is proposed. The concave growth pattern of traffic oscillations 
has been derived analytically. Furthermore, simulation results 
demonstrate that the new model well captures both macroscopic 
characteristic of traffic flow evolution and microscopic characteristic 
of car following.</p>

		<h2><font color="#E94D1C">Experimental study on properties of lightly congested flow</font></h2>
		<p style="font-size:18px";line-height: 50px align="justify">Congested 
traffic flow exhibits rather complex properties of spatiotemporal 
evolution, e.g. stop-and-go waves, phantom jams, wide scattering of 
flow-density data, etc. To the best of our knowledge, previous 
car-following experiments on circular tracks only studied heavily 
congested flow. The experimental study concerning lightly congested 
flow, which exhibits different stability characteristic from heavily 
congested flow, is still lacking. To fill this gap, very recently we 
conducted a large-scale car-following experiment on an 812-meter 
circumference circuit with densities of 0.049, 0.043 and 0.037 m−1. The 
flow-density relation of the experiment is highly consistent with the 
empirical one, which indicates that the driving behavior in the 
experiment is similar to that in real traffic. By comparing the 
macroscopic spatiotemporal evolution diagrams in different runs under 
the same global density, we found that the traffic flow exhibits 
stochastic features with even the same initial conditions. We analyzed 
the car-following behavior and its relation to the macroscopic traffic 
flow evolution. It was found that the indifference region, the 
sensitivity of drivers, and the strength of stochasticity all 
contribute to the macroscopic traffic flow evolution pattern. 
Specifically, the traffic flow becomes more homogeneous in time-space 
with the expansion of indifference region, the overall decrease of 
sensitivity and the decrease of stochasticity strength. The roles of 
stochasticity and speed adaptation were further investigated. It was 
found that stronger traffic oscillations correspond to stronger 
stochasticity and speed adaptation. The analysis for competition 
between the two effects indicated that the ratio between speed 
adaptation effect and stochastic effect grows with the increase of the 
oscillation amplitude. The stochastic effect plays a dominant role in 
car following when the oscillation amplitude is small; its influence 
wanes and the speed adaptation effect grows to outweigh the influence 
of the stochastic effect as oscillation amplitude grows. These findings 
are expected to improve our understanding of the underlying mechanism 
that produces the spatiotemporal evolution patterns of lightly 
congested flow and the data collected in this study can be used to test 
traffic models and theories. </p>

analyzed and compared with that in low speed situations. It was found 
that there is considerable heterogeneity for the same driver over 
different runs of the experiment. This intra-driver heterogeneity was 
quantitatively depicted by a new index and incorporated in an enhanced 
two-dimensional intelligent driver model. Using both the new high-speed 
and the previous low-speed experimental data, the new and three

		<h2><font color="#E94D1C">Experimental and empirical investigations of traffic flow instability</font></h2>
		<p style="font-size:18px";line-height: 50px align="justify">Traffic instability is an important but 
undesirable feature of traffic flow. This paper reports our 
experimental and empirical studies on traffic flow instability. We have 
carried out a large scale experiment to study the car-following 
behavior in a 51-car-platoon. The experiment has reproduced the 
phenomena and confirmed the findings in our previous 25-car-platoon 
experiment, i.e., standard deviation of vehicle speeds increases in a 
concave way along the platoon. Based on our experimental results, we 
argue that traffic speed rather than vehicle spacing (or density) might 
be a better indicator of traffic instability, because vehicles can have 
different spacing under the same speed. For these drivers, there exists 
a critical speed between 30 km/h and 40 km/h, above which the standard 
deviation of car velocity is almost saturated (flat) along the 
51-car-platoon, indicating that the traffic flow is likely to be 
stable. In contrast, below this critical speed, traffic flow is 
unstable and can lead to the formation of traffic jams. Traffic data 
from the Nanjing Airport Highway support the experimental observation 
of existence of a critical speed. Based on these findings, we propose 
an alternative mechanism of traffic instability: the competition 
between stochastic factors and the so-called speed adaptation effect, 
which can better explain the concave growth of speed standard deviation 
in traffic flow.</p>

		<p style="font-size:18px";line-height: 50px 
align="justify">Understanding the mechanisms responsible for the 
emergence and evolution of oscillations in traffic flow has been a 
subject of intensive research by numerous scholars. In our previous 
work, we proposed a new mechanism to explain the generation of traffic 
oscillations: traffic instability caused by the competition between 
speed adaptation and stochastic effects. By conducting a closer 
examination of car following data obtained in a 25-car platoon 
experiment, we discovered in this work that the speed difference plays 
a more important role on car-following dynamics than the spacing, and 
when its amplitude is small, the growth of oscillations is mainly 
determined by the stochastic factors that follow the mean reversion 
process; when its amplitude increases, the growth of the oscillations 
is determined by the competition between the stochastic factors and the 
speed difference. An explanation is then provided, based on the above 
findings, to why the speed variance in the oscillatory traffic grows in 
a concave way along the platoon. We also proposed a mode-switching 
stochastic car-following model that incorporates the speed adaptation 
and spacing indifference behavior of drivers, which captures the 
observed characteristics of oscillation and discharge rate. Finally, 
our sensitivity analysis shows that the influence on oscillation growth 
and discharge rate is small by the reaction delay but large by the 
indifference region boundary.</p>

		<h2><font color="#E94D1C">Empirical analysis and simulation of the evolution concavity of traffic oscillations</font></h2>
		<p style="font-size:18px";line-height: 50px 
align="justify">This paper has investigated the growth 
pattern of traffic oscillations in the NGSIM vehicle trajectories data, 
via measuring the standard deviation of vehicle velocity involved in 
oscillations. We found that the standard deviation of the velocity 
increases in a concave way along vehicles in the oscillations. 
Moreover, all datasets collapse into a single concave curve, which 
indicates a universal evolution law of oscillations. A comparison with 
traffic experiment shows that the empirical and the experimental 
results are highly compatible and can be fitted by a single concave 
curve, which demonstrates that qualitatively the growth pattern of 
oscillations is not affected by type of bottleneck and lane changing 
behavior. We have shown theoretically that small disturbances increase 
in a convex way in the initial stage in the traditional models 
presuming a unique relationship between speed and density, which 
obviously deviates from our findings. Simulations show that stochastic 
models in which the traffic state dynamically spans a 2D region in the 
speed-spacing plane can qualitatively or even quantitatively reproduce 
the concave growth pattern of traffic oscillations.</p>

		<h2> <font color="#E94D1C">Cellular Automaton Model with Dynamical 2D Speed-Gap Relation</font></h2>
		<p style="font-size:18px";line-height: 50px 
align="justify">This paper proposes an improved cellular automaton traffic flow model based on the brake light model, taking into account that the 
desired time gap of vehicles is larger than one second. Although the hypothetical steady state of vehicles in the deterministic limit corresponds to a unique 
relationship between speeds and gaps in the proposed model, the traffic states of vehicles dynamically span a two-dimensional region in the plane of speed versus 
gap, due to the various randomizations. We show that our model reproduces (i) the free flow, synchronized flow, wide moving jams, as well as transitions among 
the three phases; (ii) the evolution features of disturbances and the spatiotemporal patterns in a car-following platoon; (iii) the empirical time series of 
traffic speed obtained from Next Generation Simulation data. Furthermore, the basic feature of time headway distribution is also qualitatively reproduced. 
Therefore, we argue that a model has the potential to reproduce the empirical and experimental features of traffic flow, provided that the traffic states can 
dynamically span a 2D speed-gap region.</p>

		<h2><font color="#E94D1C">There are intensive debates about whether heterogeneous networks promote prosocial behaviors such asfairness and cooperation. Theoretical models predict that network heterogeneity plays a positive role, butthis prediction has not been validated by experiments. We reconcile this debate by conducting experimentswith two-stage ultimatum games on networks. In the first stage, we identify responders with strong fairnesspreferences, referred to as leaders. In the second stage, when leaders occupy high-degree nodes in a het.erogeneous network, their ability to motivate fairness among neighboring proposers is amplified, and collective fairness is facilitated. We propose an evolutionary game model and an agent-based simulation framework that capture the microscopic mechanisms underlving the networked experiments, Our experimentsmodel, and simulations suggest that network reciprocity is achievable but reguires coordinated interactionsbetween diferent prosocial inclinations of individuals and social network structures.</p>

		<p style="font-size:18px";line-height: 50px align="justify">We propose a two-sided market entry game and present experiments studying coordination behavior in the
game. The two-sided market in the game is operated by an intermediary monopoly platform, serving two
sides (i.e., customers and service providers) and featuring asymmetric agents, cross-side network effects,
and endogenous market capacity. The game has multiple pure-strategy Nash equilibria if at least one side
has a high willingness to enter the market and the other side’s willingness is not very low. We conduct a
laboratory experiment involving three treatments corresponding to different combinations of willingness
to enter the market among customers and service providers. The experimental results indicate that willingness
to enter the market and cross-side network effects significantly influence coordination behavior in
two-sided markets. When the multiple pure-strategy Nash equilibria are Pareto ranked on both sides, customers
and service providers can coordinate their behavior to the payoff-dominant equilibrium via tacit
coordination under strategic uncertainty. However, when the multiple pure-strategy Nash equilibria are
Pareto ranked on one side but Pareto equivalent on the other side, coordination failure and disequilibrium
occurred, and the equilibria cannot predict the aggregate behavior well. Our experimental results indicate
that a thriving two-sided market should coordinate both sides on board.</p>

align="justify">We have carried out car-following experiments with a 25-car-platoon on an open road
section to study the relation between a car’s speed and its spacing under various traffic
conditions, in the hope to resolve a controversy surrounding this fundamental relation of
vehicular traffic. In this paper we extend our previous analysis of these experiments, and
report new experimental findings. In particular, we reveal that the platoon length (hence
the average spacing within a platoon) might be significantly different even if the average
velocity of the platoon is essentially the same. The findings further demonstrate that the
traffic states span a 2D region in the speed-spacing (or density) plane. The common
practice of using a single speed-spacing curve to model vehicular traffic ignores the variability
and imprecision of human driving and is therefore inadequate. We have proposed
a car-following model based on a mechanism that in certain ranges of speed and spacing,
drivers are insensitive to the changes in spacing when the velocity differences between
cars are small. It was shown that the model can reproduce the experimental results well.</p>

		<h2><font color="#E94D1C">In order to check whether the results of traffic experiments can reveal the empirical traffic conditions, this 
study discusses the similarities and differences between them. The empirical data come from the special single-lane traffic when one lane is temporarily 
closed during the maintenance work.The experimental data are obtained from the platoons in one experiment under open boundary condition. Three perspectives are used for checking:
the statistics of all the platoons, the evolution of stable platoons and the characteristics of four important traffic flow distributions (velocity, 
time,headway, velocity difference and time-headway difference at continuous locations). We find in all these areas, the empirical data and the experimental data are qualitatively similar. 
But the quantitative differences could be measured, e.g. the oscillation amplitude of traffic parameters in the experiment is usually larger. These results can help to improve the quality of 
traffic experiments in the future.</p>

		<h2><font color="#E94D1C">A recent car-following experiment (Experiment-I) showed that the speed standard deviation grows in a concave way along a platoon of vehicles following one another. This paper investigates the growth pattern of traffic oscillations in a platoon in another car-following experiment (Experiment-II) and compares it with that in Experiment-I. It is shown that the speed standard deviation also exhibits concave growth characteristics in Experiment-II. The hypothesis test show that there is no significant difference in growth pattern of speed standard deviation between the two experiments. However, since drivers are asked to follow closely in Experiment-II, the acceleration standard deviations, the driver sensitivities, and the strength of stochastic factors are larger than the ones in Experiment-I. Furthermore, a new comparison experiment is performed which indicates that traffic oscillation growth in the platoon in the set of experiments on a circular track is likely to be equivalent to that on a straight track.</p>

		<h2><font color="#E94D1C">The paper investigates the features of emissions and fuel consumption (EFC) in a car-following platoon. Experiments based on two different car-following models and a natural concave growth pattern of the EFC along a platoon has been observed. A general conclusion of the study is that the EFC along a platoon is mainly affected by the speed standard deviation (SSD) of the platoon. The EFC model, which is based on the SSD, is developed and the model is validated by the experimental data. The results indicate that the EFC along a platoon is mainly constant along the platoon which qualitatively differs from the experimental observation. The analysis shows that the EFC along a platoon is mainly affected by the significant role of oscillation growth and reduction in EFC estimation.</p>

		<h2><font color="#E94D1C">Accurate modeling of lower-level controller plays an important role in the traffic flow of automated vehicles (AVs). However, there lacks enough attention with this respect. To address this issue, we conduct a field experiment with two vehicles that are equipped with developable autonomous driving system, where one can customize the upper-level control algorithm. Based on the field experimental data, two new lower-level control models are developed and compared with two widely used ones. The comparison results show that the proposed models outperform the two previous models in capturing the observed actual acceleration, especially the troughs of the acceleration time series. Furthermore, theoretical analysis indicates that comparing with the proposed models, the two previous models significantly overestimate the stability region of the traffic flow of the AVs and the capacity of stable traffic flow. Our study is expected to further shed light on the importance of accurate lower-level control modeling.</p>

		<h2><font color="#E94D1C">The paper focuses on the calibration of the hybrid multi-scale modelling approach that incorporates multiple levels of traffic flow representation. This paper refers to a model already developed in the literature, the Hybrid Cellular Automata (CA) and Cell Transmission Model (CTM). We use vehicle trajectory data collected from a car-following field experiment on a circular road track to explore the calibration of the CA model concerning various cell lengths through two distinct approaches: simulating all vehicles within the closed loop and simulating each vehicle using data obtained from its respective follower. We also evaluate different methods for the CTM calibration with respect to the CA model. The major findings are: 1) the calibrated parameters obtained using the simulated leader approach display greater regularity across different cell lengths; 2) the Constrained Squared Error [CsqE] method for macroscopic calibrations yielded promising results, showcasing the lowest sum of squared errors between fundamental diagrams.</p>

		<h2><font color="#E94D1C">This paper reports an experimental study on oscillation growth in mixed traffic flow of automated vehicles (AVs) and human driven vehicles (HVs). The leading vehicle moves with constant speed in the experiment. The following vehicles consist of six developable AVs and different number of HVs. Thus, the market penetration rate (MPR) of AVs decreases with the increase of platoon size. The AVs are homogeneously distributed in the platoon. The constant time gap car-following policy is adopted for the AVs and the gap is set to 1.5 s. The experiment shows that in the 7-vehicle-platoon, the oscillations grow only slightly. In the 10-vehicle-platoon, the AVs could still significantly suppress the growth of oscillations. With the further decrease of MPR of AVs in the 13- and 20-vehicle-platoon, the AVs become having no significant impact on oscillation growth. On the other hand, with the decrease of MPR of AVs, average density of the trucks and flow rate of the platoon increase, which demonstrates a trade-off between traffic stability and throughput under the given setup of AVs. The simulation study is also carried out, which exhibits good agreement with the experiment. Finally, sensitivity analysis of the parameters in the AV upper-level control algorithm has been performed, which is expected to guide future experiment design.</p>

		<h2><font color="#E94D1C">Recent empirical and theoretical findings highlight the critical role of stochasticity in car-following (CF) dynamics. Although several stochastic CF models have been proposed, their calibration remains relatively underexplored compared to deterministic models. This article addresses this gap by utilizing four stochastic CF models to conduct a comprehensive evaluation of two existing calibration methods—minimizing multiple runs mean error (MRMean) and maximum likelihood estimation (MLE) as well as a newly proposed method, minimizing multiple runs minimum (MRMin) error, based on synthetic trajectories. Results show that MRMean and MLE exhibit significant biases in estimating the ground truth values of stochastic model parameters, while MRMin achieves nearly zero estimation errors. Specifically, MRMean eliminates stochasticity, transforming models into deterministic ones, whereas MRMin successfully separates aleatoric errors caused by randomness and epistemic errors caused by parameters, as demonstrated through a theoretical error analysis. Furthermore, CF experiments conducted in an identical driving environment reveal that differences in spacing are more pronounced than differences in speed. Calibration against experimental trajectories verifies the conclusions drawn from synthetic trajectories and theoretical analysis. Additionally, the covariance matrix of parameters is estimated using bootstrap sampling, highlighting MRMin’s ability to capture the inherent stochasticity of CF behavior. These findings deepen our understanding of CF stochasticity and provide a robust framework for calibrating stochastic models.</p>
